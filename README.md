# hello-world
Here is where it all began.
I think this will be the day I start coding. I mean, I've played around with a basic HTML reader and whatnot, but today, today feels like the day! Goodbye to the misery that is lawyering. Hello, coding?

## Update
As of today (November 28, 2018, the day before I hopefully graduate from Rutgers coding bootcamp) I have decided to make this, my first github page, my profile page. I will be attempting to create this in react, and will have it deployed as I go. Feel free to watch. I am nothing if not transparent.  I don't know yet if I'm a wrangler, or a ninja, a guru or a rockstar, a sherpa, or an evangelist. What I do know is that I have over 15 years in the corporate world, sitting in front of clients and c-level management, a broad view of the business world and the balance it must maintain, and a strong desire to learn new things and enjoy my work (as should be evidenced by my career switch at age 45). I also have some strong teaching and mentoring skills. 

Take a look at my portfolio as it grows along with me. I am really just getting started, but keep watching. I promise you'll see great things from me. I'm going to be an ideal candidate for someone looking for an 'outside the box' role--I'm ready to pioneer and straddling worlds is my specialty. I can translate law to programmers and code to laywers in a way that makes sense (and with heavy use of relatable analogies).
