  <ul>
    <li> I'm a musician-turned-english major-turned-lawyer-turned-programmer.</li>
    <li> I dabbled a bit as a technical recruiter, a matrimonial attorney and a musician over the years, until I settled into about 15 years as a contracts attorney</li>
    <li> Drafting a contract and writing code have a remarkable number of similarities.
    </li>
    <li> I had a creative streak that just couldn't come out as a contracts attorney.</li>
    <li> I can't work well with people without a sense of humor. Life is too short not to laugh.</li>
    <li> I found I spent all my free time at work working on the software, customizing it, creating spreadsheets with automated functions.</li> 
    <li> I decided when I couldn't take the excessive hours at my last job to take a coding bootcamp.</li>
    <li> I'm an eternal student who discovered a passion for teaching/mentoring/tutoring, and am also currently working as a TA for the very bootcamp I attended.</li>
    <li> I'll enjoy teaching you about how to use your site as much as I enjoy setting it up.</li>
    <li> I currently prefer work with JavaScript, React, Mongo, and mySql, but I'm happy to work with you on a turnkey platform like WordPress which can get complex when you want to do 'more'.</li>
    <li> I'm a FORMER contracts attorney and HATE to negotiate or I'd still be doing it--it pays more, believe me ðŸ¤·. I will give you the lowest price at a flat fee that I think is fair after we discuss your project, and I'll give you a very detailed writeup of what you're paying for and what you're not. You are free to find somoene else, no hard feelings if its out of your budget--I encourage sticking to those-- but if you do find someone who is cheaper, chances are there's a hidden cost you'll see later. I sleep better at night when I undercharge instead of overcharging. </li>
  </ul>

  <h1 className = "trivia"> Trivia </h1>
  <ul>
    <li> I like coffee (a LOT of coffee) when I'm coding (not chardonnay), and gin or port when I'm relaxing.</li>
    <li> I'm an eternal student who discovered a passion for teaching/mentoring/tutoring.</li>
    <li> I am both a dedicated parent and an eternal child.</li>
    <li> I love to do almost anything outdoorsy. Camping, fishing and hiking top that list-- and water, *anything* to do with water.</li>
    <li> The background art on my website, the mandala, is a work in progress by my offspring, "BBL" which will evolve as their skills, and my company, grow.</li>
    <li> I really and truly appreciate anyone who actually knows why I said "not chardonnay".</li>
    <li> I can comfortably hold a meaningful conversation with anyone, as long as they want to (and sometimes when they don't but we need to).</li>
    <li> My life is complex and full of life, excitement, fun, and challenges, and I would have it no other way. </li>
    <li> This experience has taught me the value of communication, honesty, and how to manage deadlines in the face of unexpected challenges.</li>
